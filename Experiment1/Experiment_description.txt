Purpose of the Code (Aim)

This code aims to **build and train a simple neural network from scratch using only NumPy** to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It aims to:

1. **Demonstrate Core Concepts**: Teach the fundamentals of neural networks, including forward/backward propagation, activation functions (ReLU, Softmax), and gradient descent.
2. **Hands-On Learning**: Provide a clear, low-level neural network implementation without relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. **Digit Classification**: Achieve the task of classifying handwritten digits (0â€“9) using the MNIST dataset.
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Measure the model's accuracy on test data to assess its effectiveness.
5. **Serve as a Foundation**: Prepare users for understanding more advanced neural network architectures and deep learning concepts.
