Hereâ€™s a concise, point-wise explanation of the **purpose of the code** . 

---

### Purpose of the Code
1. **Demonstrate Neural Network Fundamentals**:
   - Implement a neural network from scratch using only **NumPy** to understand core concepts like forward/backward propagation, activation functions, and gradient descent.

2. **Classify Linearly Separable Data**:
   - Train a simple neural network **without a hidden layer** on the **circles dataset** to classify linearly separable data.
   - Showcase how a basic model can handle simple binary classification tasks.

3. **Classify Non-Linearly Separable Data**:
   - Train a neural network **with a hidden layer** and **ReLU activation** on the **moons dataset** to classify non-linearly separable data.
   - Demonstrate the importance of hidden layers and non-linear activation functions for complex decision boundaries.

4. **Visualize Model Performance**:
   - Use **matplotlib** to visualize decision boundaries and training progress.
   - Provide insights into how the model learns and improves over epochs.

5. **Educational Tool**:
   - Serve as a learning resource for understanding the inner workings of neural networks without relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

6. **Encourage Experimentation**:
   - Provide a clean and modular codebase to encourage experimentation with different architectures, activation functions, and datasets.
